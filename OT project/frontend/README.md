- **Pareto front**: pairwise scatter plots of f1/f2/f3 plus a table of the non-dominated timetables.

- **Fonts**: 9 title/body pairs. **Designs**: Pill Blocks, Planner Lines, Tall Columns, Glass Card, Minimal Grid.
- **Backgrounds**: solid, dots, grid paper, ruled, soft glow, paper grain. **Sizes**: phone 9:16, A4, landscape.
- **Decorate**: drag-and-drop stickers, word stickers, sticky notes, arrow callouts, and notes pinned to a class (shown as a badge and a footnote).
- Views per class, teacher or room.

## Data
The website gets its timetables from the Python server (`api/server.py`). Vite forwards `/api` requests to
port 8000; see the project README for how to start both servers. If the server is not running, the website
falls back to the demo data in `src/mock/`. `src/types.ts` matches the JSON the server returns.
